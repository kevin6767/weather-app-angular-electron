# Weather App in Electron and Angular

I have developed a dynamic weather application using Electron, Angular, OAuth2, and SQLite3. The app features a secure login system where users can authenticate via OAuth2, and their credentials are stored in a local SQLite3 database. Users can customize API keys for both OAuth2 and the weather service, with these keys stored for future use. Upon login, new users are automatically added to the database. The appâ€™s dashboard allows users to input a city name or zip code, instantly retrieving and displaying current weather data for the specified location.
